# Cricket-One
Design files for the Cricket-ONE microcontroller board

The Cricket ONE is an Arduino-compatible ATMEGA328PB based board using the Raspberry Pi 0 form factor.  
The board is compatible with a wide range of HATs and cases for the Pi 0

This board is intended to make evaluating HATs easier, or to replace a Pi Zero where that level of power is unecessary.  Or just to play with.

The Cricket-ONE can be found in small hand made quantities on Tindie, https://www.tindie.com/products/tonymac32/cricket-one-beta/
and is currently available for presale at Cyber City Circuits: https://shop.cybercitycircuits.com/products/cricket-one
